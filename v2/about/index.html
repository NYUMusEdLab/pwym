				<h1>About</h1>

				<p>"Play With Your Music" is a free, online music community where you can find like minded people
				   with whom to create and collaborate, learn to make songs of your very own, and even more using
				   the newest tools on the web. You'll learn the in's and out's of audio production, while working
				   with music you already know and love. Anyone with an interest in making music is welcome, and all
				   you need is a computer and a browser.</p>

				<p>"Play With Your Music" (or #PWYM) is a nifty collaboration between faculty in <a
						href="http://steinhardt.nyu.edu/music/">NYU
				                                                Steinhardt's Department of Music and Performing Arts
				                                                Professions</a>, <a href="https://p2pu.org">Peer 2
				                                                                                            Peer
				                                                                                            University</a>
				   and the <a href="http://media.mit.edu/">MIT Media Lab</a>.
				   Professor <a href="http://www.alexruthmann.com/blog1/">Alex Ruthmann</a> and Research Associate
					<a href="http://www.ethanhein.com/wp/">Ethan Hein</a> offer their expertise and musical chops,
				   all brought to you with the social learning design team at P2PU.</p>

				<br>

				<h1>How It works.</h1>

				<h2>The PWYM Community</h2>

				<p>When you join the <a href="http://community.playwithyourmusic.org">PWYM Community</a>,
				   you'll have access to courses and creative music making modules that focus on critical listening,
				   recording analysis, audio FX, mixing, and remixing. You'll also be able to find and create groups
				   of
				   creative and curious musicians just like you, with whom you'll learn and collaborate on course
				   projects.</p>

				<h2>Music making and learning experiences.</h2>

				<p>For each module in a course, you'll receive a series of readings, videos and an activity
				   prompting you
				   to <i>play</i> with music on the web. You'll work through the materials at your own pace, and
				   share your
				   projects with the PWYM community when your finished, and share and receive feedback on your and
				   your peers'
				   creative projects.</p>

				<h2>Support if you're lost, stuck or curious.</h2>

				<p>Play With Your Music also has an embedded <a
						href="http://community.playwithyourmusic.org">community</a>
				   of
				   like minded musicians and learners for you to ask questions, find additional resources, or
				   connect with other
				   folks outside your areas of musical interest and expertise.</p>

				<h2>Playing with your music</h2>

				<p>We've designed the PWYM courses and community in the spirit of <i>musical play</i>. Building on
				   research and
				   tools developed at the MIT Media Lab and NYU's Music Experience Design Lab, we've designed this
				   community to
				   support creative and collaborative music making, learning, and sharing. We continue to curate
				   multitrack
				   content from musical artists, develop creative tools for playing directly with the recordings you
				   love, and
				   interview leading musicians - performers, engineers, producers, and composers - all granting
					<b>YOU</b>
				   permission to play and experiment with their music.</p>
				<br>

				<h1>The Music You'll Work With.</h1>

				<h2>Peter Gabriel</h2>

				<p>For this version of PWYM (2.0!), we've partnered with dual Rock and Roll Hall of Fame inductee
				   and legend
				   Peter Gabriel. Peter has graciously collaborated with us providing access to multitrack
				   recordings of his hit
				   songs <em>Sledgehammer</em> and <em>In Your Eyes</em> from the album <b>So</b>. You'll learn from
				   video
				   interviews with Peter and with the musicians who've performed and collaborated with him over the
				   years.</p>

				<h2>Clara Berry and Wooldog</h2>

				<p>In PWYM 1.0, we partnered with singer/songwriter <a href="http://claraberry.com/">Clara Berry</a>
				   and her
				   producer/engineer <a href="http://bradfordswanson.com/?">Bradford Swanson</a> to give you an
				   inside look at
				   their recording production process. In addition to the amazing recordings of Peter Gabriel, you
				   can work
				   directly with her multitracks, samples, and loops in our
				   custom <a href="http://www.nyu.edu/projects/ruthmann/PWYM/airtraffic">#PWYM Mix tool</a> and in
					<a href="http://soundation.com/air_traffic">Soundation.com</a>.</p>
				<br>

				<h1>The Tools You'll Master.</h1>

				<p>You'll become familiar with a number of critical listening, recording and mixing tools over six
				   weeks.
				   All of these tools are free to use when you sign up for the PWYM community. A sneak preview of
				   what's to come:</p>

				<h2>Google templates for musical analysis</h2>

				<p>In the first phase of the course, you'll become familiar with the basic <i>critical listening</i>
				   and
					<i>recording analysis</i> skills of music--identifying instruments, voices, placement of sound
				   in space,
				   and song structures by ear from recordings. We start you off with identifying and describing the
				   sounds you
				   hear in a recording and locating those sounds in space with a <a
							href="https://drive.google.com/previewtemplate?id=1eoxDQyI8b5spi7rDb_zh5xoHAFt7pawO7Xry7zUHGSw&mode=public">Google
				                                                                                                                        Charts
				                                                                                                                        template</a>.
				   After that, we
				   guide you in mapping the structure of songs, labeling sections and timings, identifying when
				   instruments come
				   in and come out of a mix, helping you hear, see and understand the hidden architectures within
				   your favorite
				   musical recordings using a <a
							href="https://drive.google.com/previewtemplate?id=0Al93L9k1G7ICdFNUWUZJRUZOWHJfb2lwTHVQUGZIR0E&mode=public">Google
				                                                                                                                        Spreadsheets
				                                                                                                                        template</a>.

				<h2><a href="http://www.nyu.edu/projects/ruthmann/PWYM/airtraffic">#PWYM Mix</a></h2>

				<p>In the first phase of the course, you'll become familiar with the basic "critical listening"
				   skills of music--identifying instruments, voices and song structures. And you'll do it by playing
				   with interactive multitrack recordings.</p>

				     width="690" height="468">

				<h2><a href="http://soundation.com/">Soundation</a></h2>

				<p>Next you'll get your hands dirty by working with a Digital Audio Workstation (DAW) and learn the
				   basics of audio track editing and shifting. Using Soundation you'll mix your own audio track to
				   match a studio recording.</p>

				<img src="http://community.playwithyourmusic.org/uploads/default/23/56a9de7f3f740b27.png"
				     width="619" height="499">

				<h2><a href="https://soundcloud.com/">SoundCloud</a></h2>

				<p>Soon, you'll be remixing your favorite songs and coming up with your own glorious creations.
				   You'll post the files to SoundCloud's listening community, share them with your cohort, and give
				   each other feedback.</p>
